# 01-horiseon-website-project

## Project Overview

In this project, I undertook the task of refactoring the base code for the Horiseon website a Marketing Agency, to ensure that all HTML elements adhere to accessibility standards. The goal was to make the website more inclusive and user-friendly for all visitors, including those with disabilities.

## Key Accomplishments

- **Accessibility First:** I meticulously reviewed and adjusted the HTML structure to ensure proper semantic elements were used, headings were in sequential order, and alt attributes were added to all images. This effort enhances screen reader compatibility and overall usability.
  
- **Organized CSS:** I consolidated and organized the CSS codebase, eliminating redundancy and improving the code's readability. This ensures easier maintenance and future scalability.

- **Comments and Documentation:** I included comments within the HTML and CSS files to provide clear explanations of the code's purpose and functionality. This aids in collaboration and understanding for anyone working on the project.

## Lessons Learned

Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of the importance of web accessibility. I learned how seemingly small changes in code can have a significant impact on the user experience for individuals with disabilities. Refactoring the code to adhere to accessibility standards not only makes the website more inclusive but also improves its overall quality and usability.

Furthermore, I honed my skills in writing semantic HTML and organizing CSS code. I discovered that a well-structured codebase is not only easier to maintain but also contributes to better performance and a more intuitive development process.

## Takeaways

This project underscored the value of considering accessibility from the outset of web development projects. I am now equipped with the knowledge and skills to create websites that are not only visually appealing but also truly inclusive for all users.
